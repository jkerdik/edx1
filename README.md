# edX - massive open online course (MOOC) provider
It hosts online university-level courses in a wide range of disciplines to a worldwide student body. It also conducts research into learning based on how people use its platform. EdX differs from other MOOC providers, such as Coursera and Udacity, in that it is a nonprofit organization and runs on the Open edX open-source software. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University created edX in May 2012. More than 70 schools, nonprofit organizations, and corporations offer or plan to offer courses on the edX website. As of 29 December 2016, edX has around 10 million students taking more than 1,270 courses online. Wikipedia
