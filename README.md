# edX - massive open online course (MOOC) provider
It hosts online university-level courses in a wide range of disciplines to a worldwide student body. It also conducts research into learning based on how people use its platform.

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University created edX in May 2012. More than 70 schools, nonprofit organizations, and corporations offer or plan to offer courses on the edX website.
